# ðŸ’¡Comment

- This project is build using React. My first time learning and implementing React to my projects. It took some time to finish this but nonetheless I am proud with my progress.
-  This page is purely static with no functionalities and that is something I need to implement in the next project. I am now familiar with React - JSX, components, importing, exporting, virtual DOM, and more - the next step would be to dig deeper into hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect` and so on.

ðŸ’¥ See you in the next project!
