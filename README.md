# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

# Manage Landing Page

- Thanks to Front End Mentor for providing the assets used in this project

# Challenge

- Since I am now familiar with JavaScript I think it's time to use frameworks. This project will be made using React, this may take some time to complete since I will be simultaneously learning React and coding this project.
